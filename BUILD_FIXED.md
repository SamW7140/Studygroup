# âœ… Build Fixed - Ready to Deploy!

## What Was Wrong

1. **Malformed file** - There was a file named `import { FileText, BookOpen } from 'reac.js` that shouldn't exist
2. **ESLint errors** - Unescaped quotes in `system-prompt-editor.tsx`
3. **TypeScript errors** - References to `system_prompt` database column that doesn't exist yet

## What Was Fixed

### âœ… Removed malformed file
- Deleted: `components/dashboard/import { FileText, BookOpen } from 'reac.js`

### âœ… Fixed ESLint errors
- Updated `system-prompt-editor.tsx` to use `&apos;` and `&quot;` for quotes

### âœ… Temporarily disabled system_prompt feature
- Commented out `system_prompt` database queries until migration is run
- Added TODO comments to re-enable after database migration
- Files affected:
  - `app/actions/ai-query.ts`
  - `app/actions/classes.ts`

### âœ… Updated CORS for production
- Modified `studygroup-ai-service/main.py` to read allowed origins from env var
- Supports multiple domains (localhost + production URL)

## âœ… Build Status: SUCCESS

```bash
 âœ“ Compiled successfully
 âœ“ Linting and checking validity of types
 âœ“ Collecting page data
 âœ“ Generating static pages (10/10)
 âœ“ Collecting build traces
 âœ“ Finalizing page optimization
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### 1. Railway Deployment (Backend)
- Railway will auto-deploy from your latest push
- Check Railway dashboard in ~2-3 minutes
- Verify health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`

### 2. Vercel Deployment (Frontend)
Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and follow steps in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

### 3. After Deployment: Run Database Migration

Once deployed, run this migration on your Supabase database to enable custom system prompts:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
\i supabase/migrations/20251026_add_system_prompt_to_classes.sql
```

Or manually run:
```sql
ALTER TABLE classes
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS system_prompt TEXT;

UPDATE classes
SET system_prompt = 'You are a helpful AI teaching assistant...'
WHERE system_prompt IS NULL;
```

Then **uncomment** the code in:
- `app/actions/ai-query.ts` (lines with TODO)
- `app/actions/classes.ts` (lines with TODO)

### 4. Update CORS After Frontend Deploys

In Railway, add your Vercel URL to environment variables:
```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://your-app.vercel.app
```
