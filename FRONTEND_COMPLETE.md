## Database Setup Required

Before testing, make sure you've run these migrations:

1. **User Roles Migration** (if not done):
   ```sql
   -- Copy from: supabase/migrations/20251025_add_user_roles.sql
   ```

2. **Document Storage Migration**:
   ```sql
   -- Copy from: supabase/migrations/20251025_setup_document_storage.sql
   ```

3. **Create Storage Bucket**:
   - Go to Supabase → Storage
   - Create bucket named `documents`
   - Set as private (not public)
   - Add the 3 storage policies (see DOCUMENTS_QUICK_START.md)

## Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Sign in as professor
- [ ] Create a new class
- [ ] Upload a document to that class
- [ ] View the document in the class page
- [ ] Download the document
- [ ] View all documents at `/docs`
- [ ] Sign out and sign in as student
- [ ] View the same class
- [ ] Upload a document as student
- [ ] Verify both documents appear

## Navigation Flow

```
/auth/login
  ↓
/classes (Dashboard)
  ↓
/classes/[id] (Individual Class)
  ↓ Upload Documents
  ↓ View/Download Documents
  ↓
/docs (View All Documents)
```

## What's Next?

Now that you have the frontend working, you can:

1. **Test with real data** - Upload PDFs, PPTX files

3. **Add more features**:
   - Search/filter documents
   - Tags and categories
   - Document preview
   - Sharing and permissions
   - Class enrollment system

## Troubleshooting

- Check file type is allowed
- Verify you have upload permissions

### Documents not appearing
