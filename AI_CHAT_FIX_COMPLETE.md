# AI Chat Fix - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Problem Summary
The AI chat was broken in the right sidebar - it was using mock/simulated responses instead of connecting to the real AI service running on port 8000.

## Changes Made

### 1. **UI Store Enhancement** (`store/ui-store.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added `currentClassId` state to track which class the user is viewing
- ‚úÖ Added `currentClassName` state for display purposes
- ‚úÖ Added `setCurrentClass()` action to update class context
- **Why**: The sidebar needs to know which class context to use for AI queries

### 2. **Sidebar Right Component** (`components/layout/sidebar-right.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ Replaced mock chat with real AI integration
- ‚úÖ Connected to `queryAIWithContext()` server action
- ‚úÖ Added loading states with spinner
- ‚úÖ Added error handling with toast notifications
- ‚úÖ Added "No class selected" state
- ‚úÖ Added source citations display
- ‚úÖ Added link to full chat interface
- ‚úÖ Shows current class name badge
- **Why**: This makes the sidebar chat functional and connected to the real AI service

### 3. **Class Context Provider** (`components/layout/class-context-provider.tsx`)
- ‚úÖ New client component to automatically set class context
- ‚úÖ Sets context on mount, clears on unmount
- ‚úÖ Reusable across all class pages
- **Why**: Automatically updates the sidebar when viewing different class pages

### 4. **Updated Class Pages**
- ‚úÖ `app/(dashboard)/classes/[id]/documents/page.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `app/(dashboard)/classes/[id]/page.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `app/(dashboard)/classes/[id]/ai/page.tsx`
- **Why**: These pages now set the class context for the sidebar

## How It Works

1. **User opens a class page** ‚Üí ClassContextProvider sets currentClassId
2. **User opens sidebar AI chat** ‚Üí Sidebar reads currentClassId from store
3. **User types a question** ‚Üí Calls `queryAIWithContext(classId, question)`
4. **AI service processes** ‚Üí Returns answer with sources
5. **Sidebar displays result** ‚Üí Shows answer, sources, and confidence

## Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
- [ ] AI service running on port 8000 (`cd ..\studygroup-ai-service; python main.py`)
- [ ] Frontend running on port 3000 (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] At least one class with uploaded documents

### Test Cases
1. **Sidebar Chat - No Class Selected**

   - [ ] Open right sidebar ‚Üí Switch to AI chat tab
   - [ ] Should show "No class selected" message
   - [ ] Input should be disabled

2. **Sidebar Chat - Class Selected**
   - [ ] Navigate to any class page
   - [ ] Open right sidebar ‚Üí Switch to AI chat tab

   - [ ] Ask: "What is this course about?"
   - [ ] Should get real AI response with sources

3. **Sidebar Chat - Error Handling**
   - [ ] Stop AI service (kill port 8000)
   - [ ] Try asking a question
   - [ ] Should show error message and toast notification
   - [ ] Restart AI service and try again

4. **Full Chat Interface**
   - [ ] Go to Documents page
   - [ ] Verify full ChatInterface still works
   - [ ] Click external link icon in sidebar ‚Üí Should open full chat

5. **Context Switching**
