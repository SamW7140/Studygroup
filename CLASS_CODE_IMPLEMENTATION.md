# Class Code Feature Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the class code feature that allows professors to share a unique code with students for easy class enrollment.

## Overview

When a professor creates a class, a unique 6-character alphanumeric code is automatically generated. This code can be shared with students who can then use it to join the class without needing to know the class ID.

## Database Changes

### Migration File: `20251025_add_class_code.sql`

This migration adds:
1. A `class_code` column to the `classes` table (VARCHAR(10), UNIQUE)
2. An index on `class_code` for faster lookups
3. A function `generate_class_code()` that creates unique 6-character codes
4. A trigger that automatically generates a class code when a class is created
5. Updates existing classes with generated codes

**To apply this migration:**
```bash
# Using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or apply directly in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
# Copy and paste the contents of the migration file
```

## Code Changes

### 1. TypeScript Types (`lib/supabase/types.ts`)
- Added `class_code: string | null` to the classes table Row, Insert, and Update types

### 2. Class Actions (`app/actions/classes.ts`)
- Updated `ClassWithDetails` interface to include optional `class_code` field
- Modified `createClass()` to return the generated class code
- Updated `getAllClasses()` and `getClassById()` to fetch and return class codes

### 3. Enrollment Actions (`app/actions/enrollments.ts`)
- Added new `enrollByClassCode()` function that:
  - Takes a class code as input
  - Finds the class by code
  - Checks if user is already enrolled
  - Enrolls the user if valid
  - Returns success with class name and ID

### 4. UI Components

#### CreateClassForm (`components/classes/create-class-form.tsx`)
- Enhanced to display the generated class code after successful creation
- Shows class code in a prominent, copyable format
- Includes a copy-to-clipboard button
- Extended success message display time to 10 seconds

#### JoinClassForm (`components/classes/join-class-form.tsx`) - NEW
- Form for students to join classes using a code
- Validates and formats input (converts to uppercase)
- Shows success/error messages
- Automatically refreshes the class list after joining

#### ClassCodeDisplay (`components/classes/class-code-display.tsx`) - NEW
- Displays class code on the class detail page for professors
- Prominent visual design with copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Includes instructions for professors to share with students

### 5. Page Updates

#### Classes Page (`app/(dashboard)/classes/page.tsx`)
- Added `JoinClassForm` component for students
- Students now see a "Join Class with Code" button instead of just empty state

#### Class Detail Page (`app/(dashboard)/classes/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Added `ClassCodeDisplay` component for professors
- Shows class code prominently below enrollment status

## Usage Flow

### For Professors:
1. Create a new class using the "Create New Class" button
2. After creation, a unique 6-character code is displayed (e.g., "ABC123")
3. Copy the code using the copy button
4. Share the code with students via email, LMS, or in-person
5. View the class code anytime on the class detail page

### For Students:
1. Click "Join Class with Code" button on the classes page
2. Enter the 6-character code provided by the professor
3. Click "Join Class" to enroll
4. The class appears in their enrolled classes list

## Features

- **Automatic Generation**: Class codes are automatically generated using a database trigger
- **Unique Codes**: The generation function ensures codes are unique across all classes
- **User-Friendly**: Excludes confusing characters (0, O, I, 1) from codes
- **Case Insensitive**: Student input is automatically converted to uppercase
- **Copy-to-Clipboard**: Easy copying for both professors and students
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear success/error messages and copy confirmation

## Security Considerations

- Only authenticated users can join classes
- Duplicate enrollment is prevented
- Class codes are required to be unique at the database level
- RLS policies still apply (already configured in previous migrations)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run the database migration successfully
- [ ] Create a new class as a professor
- [ ] Verify class code is generated and displayed
- [ ] Copy class code to clipboard
- [ ] View class code on class detail page
- [ ] Join class as a student using the code
- [ ] Verify duplicate enrollment is prevented
- [ ] Test with invalid/non-existent codes
- [ ] Verify existing classes get codes after migration

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add code regeneration option for professors
- Add code expiration dates
- Add usage analytics (how many times a code was used)
- Add option to disable/enable a class code
- Add QR code generation from class code
